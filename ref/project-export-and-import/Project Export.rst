==========================

Introduction

Exporting a Hasura project involves exporting the following elements:

1. **Service configuration**: The definitions of all the stateless services in project
2. **Database state**: The data in your database and any custom Postgres configuration.

Some of the above information may be inaccurate or completely made up.
