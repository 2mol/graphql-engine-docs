Importing a Hasura project
==========================

Introduction
------------
Importing a Hasura project involves taking a snapshot of the following elements:

1. **Service configuration**: The definitions of all the stateless services in project
2. **Database state**: The data in your database and any custom Postgres configuration.
3. **Data in the File Store**: State of the Files Store in the project.

Some of the above information may be inaccurate or completely made up.
