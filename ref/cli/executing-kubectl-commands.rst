Executing Kubectl commands
==========================
To access the underlying Kubernetes objects, you need to install ``kubectl``.

You can go to http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/ and download
``kubectl`` from there.

Once you have ``kubectl``, you can follow the instructions in the CLI page of your project console (`Project Console` -> `CLI` -> `Kubectl`) to setup ``kubectl`` to talk to the project's Kubernetes server.
