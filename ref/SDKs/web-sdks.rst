Web SDKs
========
The following is a list of web SDKs that can be used to integrate frontend code with backend APIs. They can be used to integrate both Hasura micro-services (Data, Auth/User-management and FileStore) and custom services.

JavaScript SDK
--------------
The documentation for the Javascript SDK can be found here: https://github.com/hasura/js-sdk

Other SDKs
----------
Web SDKs in other languages are currently WIP. If you want an early preview of or want to contribute to these SDKs, please write to us at support@hasura.io.
