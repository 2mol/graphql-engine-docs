Hasura's migration system
=========================

Hasura's migration tooling is based on the amazing Rails ActiveRecord migration system.

Hasura console migrations
-------------------------

The Hasura console automatically generates migrations as you use the UI, as long as you are in the "migrations mode".

Once you create a table on the console, head to the ``migrations/`` directory in your project and you'll see the migrations being created.
