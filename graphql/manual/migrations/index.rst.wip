Migrations, version control and collaboration
=============================================

Hasura comes with powerful migration tooling to help you work on a new postgres database or with existing postgres databases.

As you use the Hasura console to make changes to your schema migration files are automatically generated on your local filesystem
that you can edit directly and check into version control.
