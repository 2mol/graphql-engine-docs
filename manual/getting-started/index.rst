Getting started
===============


If you'd like to evaluate Hasura quickly, head to the `hello-world quickstart project <https://hasura-stg.hasura-app.io/hub/project/hasura/hello-world>`_. The ``hello-world`` project comes with a sample database and a microservice (custom API), so that you can explore the Hasura APIs and explore a simple working project.

Alternatively, if you'd like to get a deep understanding of how Hasura works, head to :doc:`The complete tutorial <../tutorial/index>`.
