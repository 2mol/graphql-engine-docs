Free trial
==========

A free trial project is available on signing up at `Hasura Project Dashboard`_. This project is meant for experimenting with the platform. After the free trial ends, developers can migrate the project (custom services, database schema) to another project on their own public infrastructure like AWS, Google Cloud, etc. or to a local-development project (see :ref:`Public Cloud installation <cloud_installation>` and :ref:`Local Development <local_development>`. Alternatively, the trial period may be extended by writing to support@hasura.io.

Infrastructure for trial projects is recycled after the trial period ends and no back ups are available.

.. note:: 

   * Before the free trial ends:

     * Important data in the trial project's database must be backed up
     * Project configuration must be exported if the project is to be migrated

   * Extension of trial period is subject to availability of infrastructure.
