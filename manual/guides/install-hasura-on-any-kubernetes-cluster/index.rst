Install Hasura on any Kubernetes Cluster
========================================

With the introduction of a new CLI command :ref:`hasura cluster install
<hasura_cluster_install>`, you can install Hasura on any Kubernetes cluster.

While generic configuration method is available by writing cluster definition
in a yaml file, we have made it very easy to install Hasura on Minikube and
Docker for Desktop.
